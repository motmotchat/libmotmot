/**
 * paxos_commit - Commit a value for an instance of the Paxos protocol.
 *
 * We totally order calls to paxos_learn by instance number in order to make
 * the join and greet protocols behave properly.  This also gives our chat
 * clients an easy mechanism for totally ordering their logs without extra
 * work on their part.
 *
 * It is possible that failed DEC_PART decrees (i.e., decrees in which the
 * proposer attempts to disconnect an acceptor who a majority of acceptors
 * believe is still alive) could delay the learning of committed chat
 * messages.  To avoid this, once a proposer receives enough rejections
 * of the decree, the part decree is replaced with a null decree.  The
 * proposer can then issue the part again with a higher instance number
 * if desired.
