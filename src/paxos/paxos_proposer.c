/**
 * proposer_prepare - Broadcast a prepare message to all acceptors.
 *
 * The initiation of a prepare phase is only allowed if we believe ourselves
 * to be the proposer.  Once we start a prepare phase, we wait until a majority
 * either accepts our prepare our redirects us to a higher-ranked acceptor.
 * In the latter case, if we cannot reconnect with the purported proposer,
 * we try again to prepare.
 *
 * Thus, we call proposer_prepare() iff we believe ourselves to be the
 * proposer, and we do not stop the cycle of waiting on responses and starting
 * a new prepare until we either connect to a proposer or our prepare is
 * accepted by a majority.
 *
 * Whenever a prepare succeeds, the new proposer kills off any higher-ranked
 * acceptors that remain.  This allows us to provide a useful system invariant:
 *
 *  ===========================================================================
 *    ONCE A PROPOSER SUCCESSFULLY PREPARES, IT REMAINS THE PROPOSER UNTIL IT
 *    DROPS OUT OF THE SYSTEM
 *  ===========================================================================
 *
 * (or loses connection to a majority, which is equivalent).  Of course, the
 * cycle of prepares might still fail, in which case we remain in line behind
 * some number of higher-ranked acceptors, and if they all leave or fail, we
 * will at that point begin another cycle of prepares.
 *
 * Any time we discover that we are first in line to be proposer, we initiate
 * a prepare synchronously.  Moreover, we only ever free a prepare if we have
 * connected to a higher-ranked acceptor to whom we defer proposership, or if
 * we have successfully prepared.  Thus, from anywhere except the codepath
 * between detecting our proposership and preparing, we can check whether we
 * are a prepared proposer by simply checking whether pax->prep is NULL.
